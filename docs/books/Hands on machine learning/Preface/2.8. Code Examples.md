# **Code Examples**

Supplemental material (code examples, exercises, etc.) is available for download at [https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2). It is mostly composed of Jupyter notebooks.

Some of the code examples in the book leave out some repetitive sections, or details that are obvious or unrelated to Machine Learning. This keeps the focus on the important parts of the code, and it saves space to cover more topics. However, if you want the full code examples, they are all available in the Jupyter notebooks.

Note that when the code examples display some outputs, then these code examples are shown with Python prompts (>>> and ...), as in a Python shell, to clearly distinguish the code from the outputs. For example, this code defines the square() function then it computes and displays the square of 3:

``` py
def square(x):
    return x ** 2
...
result = square(3)
result
```
9

When code does not display anything, prompts are not used. However, the result may
sometimes be shown as a comment like this:

``` py
def square(x):
    return x ** 2
    
result = square(3)
result # result is 9
```

# **Machine Learning in Your Projects**

So naturally you are excited about Machine Learning and you would love to join the party!

Perhaps you would like to give your homemade robot a brain of its own? Make it recognize faces? Or learn to walk around?

Or maybe your company has tons of data (user logs, financial data, production data, machine sensor data, hotline stats, HR reports, etc.), and more than likely you could unearth some hidden gems if you just knew where to look; for example:

- Segment customers and find the best marketing strategy for each group

- Recommend products for each client based on what similar clients bought

-  Detect which transactions are likely to be fraudulent

- Forecast next yearâ€™s revenue

# **Objective and Approach**

This book assumes that you know close to nothing about Machine Learning. Its goal is to give you the concepts, the intuitions, and the tools you need to actually implement programs capable of <em>learning from data.</em>

We will cover a large number of techniques, from the simplest and most commonly used (such as linear regression) to some of the Deep Learning techniques that regularly win competitions.

Rather than implementing our own toy versions of each algorithm, we will be using actual production-ready Python frameworks:

- [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) is very easy to use, yet it implements many Machine Learning algorithms efficiently, so it makes for a great entry point to learn Machine Learning.

- [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org/) is a more complex library for distributed numerical computation. It makes it possible to train and run very large neural networks efficiently by distributing the computations across potentially hundreds of multi-GPU servers. TensorFlow was created at Google and supports many of their large-scale Machine Learning applications. It was open sourced in November 2015.

- [Keras](https://keras.io/) is a high level Deep Learning API that makes it very simple to train and run neural networks. It can run on top of either TensorFlow, Theano or Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (formerly known as CNTK). TensorFlow comes with its own implementation of this API, called <em>tf.keras</em>, which provides support for some advanced TensorFlow features (e.g., to efficiently load data).

The book favors a hands-on approach, growing an intuitive understanding of Machine Learning through concrete working examples and just a little bit of theory. While you can read this book without picking up your laptop, we highly recommend you experiment with the code examples available online as Jupyter notebooks at [https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2).

# **Prerequisites**

This book assumes that you have some Python programming experience and that you are familiar with Python’s main scientific libraries, in particular [NumPy](http://numpy.org/), [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), and [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/).

Also, if you care about what’s under the hood you should have a reasonable understanding of college-level math as well (calculus, linear algebra, probabilities, and statistics).

If you don’t know Python yet, [http://learnpython.org/](http://learnpython.org/) is a great place to start. The official tutorial on [python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) is also quite good.

If you have never used Jupyter, ***Chapter 2*** will guide you through installation and the basics: it is a great tool to have in your toolbox.

If you are not familiar with Python’s scientific libraries, the provided Jupyter notebooks include a few tutorials. There is also a quick math tutorial for linear algebra.

# **Other Resources**

Many resources are available to learn about Machine Learning. Andrew Ng’s [ML course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) and Geoffrey Hinton’s [course on neural networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets) are amazing, although they both require a significant time investment (think months).

There are also many interesting websites about Machine Learning, including of course Scikit-Learn’s exceptional [User Guide](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html). You may also enjoy [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/), which provides very nice interactive tutorials, and ML blogs such as those listed on [Quora](https://homl.info/1). Finally, the [Deep Learning website](http://deeplearning.net/) has a good list of resources to learn more.

Of course there are also many other introductory books about Machine Learning, in
particular:

- Joel Grus, [Data Science from Scratch](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033400.do) (O’Reilly). This book presents the fundamentals of Machine Learning, and implements some of the main algorithms in pure Python (from scratch, as the name suggests).

- Stephen Marsland, <em>Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective</em> (Chapman and Hall). This book is a great introduction to Machine Learning, covering a wide range of topics in depth, with code examples in Python (also from scratch, but using NumPy).

- Sebastian Raschka, <em>Python Machine Learning</em> (Packt Publishing). Also a great
introduction to Machine Learning, this book leverages Python open source libra‐
ries (Pylearn 2 and Theano).

- François Chollet, <em>Deep Learning with Python</em> (Manning). A very practical book
that covers a large range of topics in a clear and concise way, as you might expect
from the author of the excellent Keras library. It favors code examples over math‐
ematical theory.

- Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa, Malik Magdon-Ismail, and Hsuan-Tien Lin, <em>Learning from Data</em> (AMLBook). A rather theoretical approach to ML, this book provides deep insights, in particular on the bias/variance tradeoff (see ***Training Models***).

- Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, <em>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 3rd
Edition</em> (Pearson). This is a great (and huge) book covering an incredible amount
of topics, including Machine Learning. It helps put ML into perspective.

Finally, a great way to learn is to join ML competition websites such as [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/) this will allow you to practice your skills on real-world problems, with help and insights from some of the best ML professionals out there.
